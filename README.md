Their average nightly prices range from around $42 to $264.
Seasonality & Bookings:Bookings peak in June (13,588 bookings) and decline sharply by September.Summer months (May–August) are the busiest, likely due to tourism patterns.

conclusion:-The analysis demonstrates that location, room type, and host quality are the main drivers of Airbnb performance in NYC. Manhattan and Brooklyn dominate both in volume and revenue potential. Meanwhile, price-sensitive guests may look to the Bronx or Queens for more affordable options. Listings with entire homes and responsive hosts gain more reviews and likely have higher occupancy rates.
