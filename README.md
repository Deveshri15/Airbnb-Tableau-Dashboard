# Airbnb-Tableau-Dashboard


Introduction:- This project represents a airbnb analysis.
In this project, Airbnb has been analyzed as follows:

I first understood the Airbnb data set.
Data Cleaning:-
The data has cleaned and pre-processed before visualized the data. Any missing values or outliers had removed to get an accurate analysis.
Dashboard Creation:-
The visualizations has combined into a dashboard. The dashboard provides an overview of the data and allowed users to interact with the data by filtering, selecting, and sorting the data.
Analyzed the total number of booking by room type and Neighbourhood group.

Visualizations:-

I observed that Brookly and Manhattan are densly populated with Airbnb listings. 
It's pretty obvious that both Manhattan and Brookly are famous for tourism.
Three types of rooms are availble in Airbnb listings i.e Entire home/Apt,private room and share room.
Most Common Room Type:Entire home/apt has booked most frequently across all neighborhoods.
In the treemap,Average price by Neighbourhood group for room type,manhattan average price is $ 196.88 which is increased other than of neighbourhood group and Lowest Average Price Bronx – $87.50.
Top Hosts by Total Reviews,Top-reviewed hosts include Brooklyn Breakfast (~2,205 reviews), Maya in Queens (~2,273), Danielle in Queens (~2,017), Brady in Brooklyn (~1,818), among others.
Their average nightly prices range from around $42 to $264.

In the map,Average price of neighbourhood group has increased of manhattan and brooklyn.
Seasonality & Bookings:Booking increased in June month (13,588 bookings) and decline sharply by September.Summer months bookings are full.


conclusion:-The analysis demonstrates that location, room type, and host quality are the main drivers of Airbnb performance in NYC. Manhattan and Brooklyn dominate both in volume and revenue potential. Meanwhile, price-sensitive guests may look to the Bronx or Queens for more affordable options. Listings with entire homes and responsive hosts gain more reviews and likely have higher occupancy rates.
